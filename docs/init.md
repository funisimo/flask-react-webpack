# init

You'll need to initialize the web app in order to make yourself the admin. You can do this by going to the `/init` URL 
in this web app.

### SendGrid

At initialization you'll be required to enter a SendGrid API key. On localhost you can enter a fake API key (just a 
random string) because you'll be able to read emails in the Terminal. But on production use the real API key. For this 
you'll need to first create yourself a SendGrid account (their free tier would do).
